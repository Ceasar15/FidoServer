Developed a Python application with the following menu:

    Get OTP
    Check Balance
    Request for a callback


1. Get OTP - based on the client's phone number (session-id), you return an OTP from a DB (return any random 4 digits random value in this case).
2. Check balance - for this menu, the client has to input their id. if Id is valid you return their balance.
3. Request for a callback - log the request and send feedback and SMS to the customer to expect a callback.
